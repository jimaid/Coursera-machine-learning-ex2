 # Coursera Machine Learning Ex2
This is the second programming assignment of the Coursera Stanford Machine Learning Course. 
It is about the implementation of Logistic Regression and applying it to two different datasets. 
There are different files but the ones listed below are the files that are to be completed and submitted for grading. 

- PlotData.m -- Function to plot 2D classification Data
- sigmoid.m  -- Sigmoid Function
- costFunction.m -- Logistic Regression Cost Function
- predict.m -- Logistic Regression Prediction Function
- costFunctionReg.m -- Regularized Logistic Regression Cost Function

These files have been completed in this repo.
